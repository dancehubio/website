Hi! I am Haytham! A Salsa dancer in Toronto, Canada!

I love social dancing of all sorts, and I love teaching it as it is not only about dance, but about life and discouvering thyself! Please join me in this journey of sharing my love for dance through blogs, resources and videos!

Get in touch by emailing [playfuldanceacademy@gmail.com](mailto:playfuldanceacademy@gmail.com)!
